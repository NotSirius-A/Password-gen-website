There is no database.
I've considered implementing a DB, however for this project it's pointless, for few reasons:
    - Some time ago I wrote the password gen in native python, it was meant to be a simple/small project, which
    I decided to write a website for.
    I never intended to use a DB, a simple .csv file was good enough. Adding DB support would take a lot of time and offer little benefit.
    - I don't plan to scale this site in any way, it's an educational project.
    - DB would add complexity
