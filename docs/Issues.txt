If this list is still here it means I didn't have time to take care of these issues:
    - Mediocre file structure/managment
    - Mediocre UI/UX
    - Low quality code in some places (API code is pretty bad)
    - Requests should be made with JS to an API, but at the time of writing this, I don't know JavaScript
